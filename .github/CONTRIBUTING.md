# How to contribute
Any help towards improving FluentFlyout is greatly appreciated!

To start developing, load the repository into Visual Studio, make sure that FluentFlyout is closed (singleton app), and start writing!
Make sure to create a new branch when starting. Once you're ready, submit a pull request and be sure to tag any issues (if applicable) your pull request is taking care of!
