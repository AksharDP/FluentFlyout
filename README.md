FluentFlyout is a simple and modern audio flyout for Windows, built with Fluent 2 Design principles.  
The UI seemingly blends in with Windows 10/11, providing you an uninterrupted, clean, and native-like experience when controlling your media.  

FluentFlyout features smooth animations, supports both light and dark modes, blends with your system's color theme, and includes multiple layout positions while providing media controls and information in a nice and modern looking popup flyout, just above the native volume flyout.
