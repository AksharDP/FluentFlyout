FluentFlyout is a simple and modern audio flyout for Windows, built with Fluent 2 Design principles.  
The UI seemingly blends in with Windows 10/11, providing you an uninterrupted, clean, and native-like experience when controlling your media.  

FluentFlyout features smooth animations, supports both light and dark modes, blends with your system's color theme, and includes multiple layout positions while providing media controls and information in a nice and modern looking popup flyout, just above the native volume flyout.

### Using .msixbundle installer
> [!Important]
> It's highly recommended to download FluentFlyout from MS store, as it's more convenient and provides auto updates
1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/unchihugo/FluentFlyout/releases/latest) page
2. Download the **"*.cer"** file *(I'm too poor to afford a real certificate)*
3. Open the certificate and press **"Install Certificate..."**
4. On the Certificate Import Wizard, select **"Local Machine"**, press **"Next"** and grant Admin Access
5. Select **"Place all certificates in the following store"**, then **"Browse..."**, choose **"Trusted Root Certification Authorities"** and **"OK"**
6. Finally, press **"Next"** and then **"Finish"**. It might ask you to confirm, press **Yes**
7. Download **"FluentFlyout_*.msixbundle"**
8. The App Installer will pop up, press **"Install"**, or **"Update"** if you've installed FluentFlyout before
9. done! try playing music and use your media or volume keys
